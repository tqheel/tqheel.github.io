By: Vivek Chintala

This year’s Boot Camp started like every other boot camp- a bunch of new scouts at the muster eager for their first camping trip by themselves. So we all met up at the Food Line muster and drove out to Camp Campbell in Virginia to campsites 22-25. The first night we had a fire until lights out. But, then the Civil war of the Fire Monkeys began and went on for some time until there was a broken tent! Finally, they had a truce until the next day.

We all woke up on Saturday, half of us were warm during the night, and the other cold. Nonetheless, we cooked breakfast. The new scouts used a Dutch oven for their breakfast which was Mountain man, but it did take a while, so in the meantime, the scouts warmed their hands up around the hot coals.

Their first activity was with fire, which was instructed by me and Ethan Fuller. The scouts learned the different ways to build a fire before lighting it. Next, they learned how to use propane stove and backpacking stoves, and learned when they should use them. Then, they went over to the shelter and each scout had to build and make a fire last for at least 2 minutes. ALL of the scouts passed with flying colors! Thats how all of the new scouts officially got their Firem’n Chit.

Then they went over to the axe yard with their troop guides and met their instructors there, Zachary Sandman and Ian Fuller.They learned how to safely enter and exit an axe yard, how to safely give the tools to other scouts, and how to safely use an axe, pocket knife, and a saw. They then completed the requirements for the Totin’ Chip, which allowed them to whittle in their free time.

Then after lunch, we took a break for an hour before starting with the activities again. The new scouts learned the knots needed for Scout rank. They were the square knot, two half-hitches, tautline hitch, and the bowline knot. Later on, they moved onto to navigation with Mr. Verdery, where they learned how to navigate with tent stakes and how to use compasses.

After the activities, the scouts just hung out and played some games like football and hide and seek. Then the new scouts cooked quesadillas in foil packets, which were put in the fire. Then everyone went over to the adult campsite and learned how to properly use a Dutch oven and even helped with the preparations for 3 different types of cobbler, apple, chocolate and blueberry.

Afterwards, everyone went back to the other campsite while the cobbler was cooking and just hung out by the fire until Mr. Verdery and Mr. Wall showed the new scouts nighttime navigation with the stars. They learned how to find the true north and how to find constellations. But since there was cloud cover, they weren’t able to see the Big Dipper.

By the time nighttime navigation ended, the cobbler was over. So we all went back to the adult campsite and had some delicious cobbler. Then all the scouts hung out by the fire after returning back to the campsite until lights out.

As the sun rose on Sunday, the scouts started packing all their gear up and ate a light breakfast. After breakfast, we started to clean up and put our patrol boxes and personal gear by the trailer. Then we did some quick police lines to make sure that the campsite was clean. Lastly, before we left, we all did Roses, Buds and Thorns, where we basically told everyone what we liked about the trip, what we didn’t and what we could improve on in the future. That's all!
