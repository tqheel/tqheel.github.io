## Outdoor Adventurer

1. With the help of your den leader or family, plan and participate in an outdoor activity.
2. Discuss with your den or family what actions you should take in the case of the following extreme weather events:
    - A. Severe rainstorm causing flooding
    - B. Severe thunderstorm with lightning or tornadoes
    - C. Fire, earthquake, or other disaster that will require evacuation. Discuss  what you have done to minimize as much danger as possible.
3. **Show how to tie a bowline. Explain when this knot should be used and why. Teach it to another Scout who is not a Webelos Scout (This week's focus).**
4. Recite the Outdoor Code and the Leave No Trace Principles for Kids from memory. Talk about how you can demonstrate them while you are working on your Arrow of Light. After one outing, list the things you did to follow the Outdoor Code and Leave No Trace.

## Activity 1: Learn and Practie a Bowline Knot

- Each Scout will tie a bowline knot and learn when it is used (for rescues) and why (because it doesn’t slip).
- Note: Each Scout must also follow up after the meeting by teaching the knot to a younger Scout who isn’t yet a Webelos Scout.

## Activity 2

- Once Scouts have mastered the bowline knot, set up a rope relay. Divide the den into two teams.
- Give each team a rope and have them tie it to a fence, table, or other solid object so they have only one end to work with (simulating a rescue situation).
- The teams stand single file opposite their ropes and, in turn, each teammate runs to the rope, ties a bowline around their waist, then leans back until the rope is taut but doesn’t slip.
- Verify each knot is correct. Once this is done, the player unties the knot, returns to their team, and tags the next Scout, who repeats the process.
- The team that finishes first wins. If you have an uneven number of Scouts, the first player on one team will go twice.
