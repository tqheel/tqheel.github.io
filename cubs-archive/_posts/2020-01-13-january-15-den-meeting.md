- 1/29 is the Pack Meeting, which wil include a parents meeting to talk about the spring and fall opertions of the Pack.
- 1/31 is setup for the Pinewood Derby, starting at 7:00. As our Den is responsible for the Cub Carnival, we may need to plan on using this time to stage the activities for the event.
- 2/1 is the Pinewood Derby at the Church.
- Cub hike on 2/8.
- Next Adventure is going to be Bear Claws (pocket knives), so get prepared!
