title: "September 30 Den Meeting: Cast Iron Chef Review"
---

## Location: Virtually Over Zoom (see email for details)

## Opening

1. Pledge of Allegiance
2. Has anyone lived the Scout Law since our last meeting?

## Talk Time

1. Popcorn sales are underway. All commisions for your Scout will go directly towards dues for next year, rather than to the Pack. Also, the Council could really use your support, as popcorn sales help provide quality local programs and facilities for all units to enjoy.
2. The Pack Fall Camping Trip is on! One night only this year. See Debbie's earlier email this week for more details, but you need to start tracking body temperatures this coming weekend for all attendees. All family members are invited to attend. Webelos will be helping with Saturday dinner this year. We'll talk more about that over the next couple of den meetings. Hopefully, we will be able to apply some of what we have learned during Cast Iron Chef!
