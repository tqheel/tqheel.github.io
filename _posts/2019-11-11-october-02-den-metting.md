of them with your family or den
3. Do at least two of the following:
   - 3A. With your school or den, visit a local sheriff’s office, police station, or fire department OR talk with a fire safety
officer or law enforcement officer visiting your school or den. Find out what skills the officers use to do their jobs. Ask
questions that will help you learn how to stay safe (We will be doing this with some other Dens at Genesis, but may not be until January).
   - 3B. Make a list of emergency numbers and discuss with your family where the list should be kept. Show your family
that you know how to call for help in an emergency. Talk with your family about people who could help you if a parent
is not available.

family can determine the emergency, or you can develop several plans.**
